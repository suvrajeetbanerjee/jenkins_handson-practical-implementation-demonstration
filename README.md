# Jenkins Learning Outcomes

## Overview
This repository documents my learning journey with Jenkins, focusing on its architecture, configurations, and practical applications. The learning outcomes are based on a comprehensive Jenkins tutorial series by DevopsCube[](https://x.com/devopscube/status/1947869355292668285) explored on July 28, 2025, at 12:19 AM IST. This README builds on my initial revision and dives deeper into the concepts covered.

## Learning Outcomes

### 1. Jenkins Architecture and Components
- **Overview**: Gained a solid understanding of Jenkins architecture, including the master node, agent nodes, and web interface.
- **Master Node**: Learned that the Jenkins master node manages job scheduling, monitoring, and orchestration of workflows.
- **Agent Nodes**: Discovered that agents execute job steps, with options for static (Linux/Windows servers) or dynamic (Docker/Kubernetes) configurations.
- **Web Interface**: Explored the Blue Ocean interface for visualizing pipelines, enhancing workflow management.

| - Build/Test/Deploy|    | - Build/Test/Deploy|
+--------------------+    +--------------------+
```



- **Description**: A top-down diagram showing the Jenkins master connected to multiple agent nodes via SSH or JNLP. Each agent performs job execution tasks, with examples of a static Linux server and a dynamic Docker container.

### 2. Agent Configuration and Connectivity
- **Methods**: Studied SSH (port 22) and JNLP (port 50000) methods for master-agent connectivity.
- **Static Agents**: Learned that agent nodes (e.g., Windows/Linux) can run continuously and are managed with custom scripts for downtime.
- **Dynamic Agents**: Explored cloud agents that deploy on-demand (e.g., Kubernetes pods) and terminate post-job.

```
+--------------------+
|    Jenkins Master  |
| - Port 22 (SSH)    |
| - Port 50000 (JNLP)|
+--------------------+

|-----------------+
|                 |
+--------------------+    +--------------------+
|    Static Agent    |    |    Dynamic Agent   |
| - Linux Server     |    | - Kubernetes Pod   |
| - Always Running   |    | - On-Demand        |
+--------------------+    +--------------------+
```

- **Description**: A diagram illustrating the Jenkins master with two connectivity options (SSH and JNLP) linking to a static agent (Linux server) and a dynamic agent (Kubernetes pod).

### 3. Jenkins Clouds and Build Agents
- **Cloud Agents**: Understood how Docker containers and Kubernetes pods serve as build agents, reducing infrastructure costs.
- **Examples**: Reviewed tutorials on setting up Jenkins on Kubernetes clusters and using AWS ECS as a build slave.

+--------------------+    +--------------------+
|    Cloud Agents    |    |    Cloud Agents    |
| - Docker Container |    | - Kubernetes Pod   |
| - On-Demand Build  |    | - Autoscaling      |
+--------------------+    +--------------------+
|                   |
v                   v
+--------------------+    +--------------------+
|    Job Execution   |    |    Job Execution   |
| - Build/Deploy     |    | - Build/Deploy     |
+--------------------+    +--------------------+
```

- **Description**: A diagram showing the Jenkins master dispatching jobs to cloud-based agents (Docker and Kubernetes), with each agent handling build and deploy tasks.

### 4. Data Security and Backup
- **Data Location**: Identified that Jenkins data is stored in `/var/lib/jenkins/`, including job configs and secrets.
- **Backup Importance**: Learned the necessity of daily backups and securing the secrets directory (e.g., using external tools like Vault).
- **Production Setup**: Noted the practice of attaching a dedicated volume for Jenkins data in production environments.

|    Restored Data   |
| - On Corruption    |
+--------------------+
```

- **Description**: A flow diagram depicting the Jenkins master storing data, the backup process, and data restoration in case of corruption.

### 5. Jenkins Blue Ocean Interface
- **Features**: Experienced the intuitive Blue Ocean interface for pipeline visualization.
- **Benefits**: Appreciated its role in simplifying pipeline management and providing a modern UI.

#### Pictorial Diagram: Blue Ocean Interface

```
+--------------------+
|    Blue Ocean UI   |

### 6. Plugins and Enhancements
- **Functionality**: Investigated plugins like AWS Steps for S3 uploads, enhancing native capabilities.
- **Installation**: Learned to install plugins via the dashboard or manually by copying to `/var/lib/jenkins/plugins/`.
- **Security**: Noted the importance of proxy setup for corporate networks and custom plugin development.
